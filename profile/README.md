# PlentiFi - Blockchain Made Easy 🔗

Welcome to PlentiFi! PlentiFi is designed to simplify the implementation and usage of blockchain technology. Developed by Amaury Denny and Nathan Hervier, this solution addresses the barriers to entry for both developers and end-users, aiming to make blockchain as accessible and user-friendly as Web2 applications. PlentiFi is a non-custodial Account Abstraction solution powered by biometrics, enabling seamless interaction with blockchain protocols.

## ⌚️ State of the Art

Onboarding in the blockchain space has been a significant challenge due to complex security measures like 12-word recovery phrases. Existing solutions often require trust in third parties or have not yet achieved a Web2-like user experience. PlentiFi enhances the state-of-the-art by integrating WebAuthn, allowing transactions to be signed using biometric data. This approach improves security and user-friendliness while adhering to decentralized principles.
