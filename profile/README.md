# PlentiFi - Blockchain Made Easy üîó

Welcome to PlentiFi!  
PlentiFi is designed to simplify the implementation and usage of blockchain technology. This solution addresses the barriers to entry for both developers and end-users, aiming to make blockchain as accessible and user-friendly as Web2 applications. PlentiFi is a non-custodial Account Abstraction solution powered by biometrics and session keys, enabling seamless interaction with blockchain protocols.

## ‚åöÔ∏è State of the Art

Onboarding in the blockchain space has been a significant challenge due to complex security measures like 12-word recovery phrases. Existing solutions often require trust in third parties or have not yet achieved a Web2-like user experience. PlentiFi enhances the state-of-the-art by integrating WebAuthn, allowing transactions to be signed using biometric data. This approach improves security and user-friendliness while adhering to decentralized principles.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

### For Developers and Businesses:
- **TypeScript Toolkit**: Simplifies Web3 integration without requiring specialized knowledge. The platform handles all blockchain aspects, from generating functions to managing wallets üõ†Ô∏è
- **Easy Integration**: Developers register on the platform, receive a business ID, and can start with just five lines of code üöÄ
- **Module Connection**: Connect any module to user accounts (smart wallets) to enable specific features and delegate capacities, utilizing ERC-7579 üîó

### For Users:
- **Quick Onboarding**: Requires only a username, email, and password initially, with plans for username-only registration in the future üìù
- **Non-custodial Wallet**: Provides an instantly functional wallet across all supported EVMs with the same address üíº
- **Biometric Authentication**: Transactions are authorized via biometrics (webAuthn), eliminating the need for seed phrases üîê
- **Multi-device Compatibility**: Use the same account across multiple devices üíª
- **Privacy Features**: Includes burner wallets and ring signatures, with an optional app for managing you account üîí

## PlentiFi on the XRP Ledger: System Design Diagrams and Narrative <img src="https://cryptologos.cc/logos/xrp-xrp-logo.png?v=032" alt="XRP" width="20"/>

### Create a Smart Account on the XRP Ledger

### Smart Account Transaction on XRPL
![Screenshot from 2024-07-24 11-19-32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c046e6-1824-4f2e-b1ac-1e1960f96faa)


**Custom Account Abstraction Mechanism**
Since the XRPL does not support smart contracts in the same way as EVM-compatible blockchains, PlentiFi has developed a custom account abstraction mechanism tailored for the XRP Ledger. This mechanism utilizes the ledger's built-in multi-signature feature to offer robust authentication and account management.

- **Multi-Signature Authentication**: The XRPL's multi-signature feature allows multiple keys to authorize transactions. PlentiFi uses this to secure user accounts, enabling a multi-layered authentication process that enhances security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Recovery Options**: Even if a user loses access to one of their devices, the multi-signature setup ensures that they can still recover their account using other authorized devices. This approach eliminates the need for users to store seed phrases or manage private keys, significantly reducing the friction associated with traditional blockchain wallets.

**Developer SDK**
The PlentiFi SDK abstracts the complexities of interacting with the XRPL, allowing developers to integrate blockchain functionalities with minimal effort.
- **Seamless Onboarding**: By simplifying the onboarding process, the SDK enables developers to quickly bring new users onto the XRPL without requiring them to understand the underlying blockchain technology.

**XRPL EVM Sidechain Integration**
PlentiFi also integrates with an EVM sidechain to enhance its offering, leveraging EIP-4337 for advanced account management features.

- **EIP-4337 Deployment**: The deployment of EIP-4337 on the EVM sidechain introduces account abstraction capabilities that are compatible with the XRPL. This includes a public bundler RPC to facilitate user operations and the creation of smart accounts using biometrics (WebAuthn).
- **Smart Account Factory**: PlentiFi's smart account factory utilizes ERC-7579 to allow developers to connect various modules to user accounts. This enables extensive customization and the addition of specific features tailored to user needs.

Additionally, PlentiFi, our non-custodial smart wallet application, plays a crucial role in this ecosystem. PlentiFi allows users to have a single address across all supported EVMs without storing a private key, utilizing biometric authentication (WebAuthn). Users do not need to download an app, enhancing accessibility. For developers, PlentiFi simplifies blockchain integration, enabling any blockchain action with just three lines of code.

### Non-Custodial Solution

PlentiFi is a non-custodial solution, meaning users have full control over their private keys and assets. This enhances security and ensures that users are the sole owners of their funds.

### Use of Biometrics and Session Keys

To provide a seamless and secure user experience, PlentiFi utilizes biometric authentication (WebAuthn) and session keys. This approach eliminates the need for traditional seed phrases, making the onboarding process straightforward and secure. Users can authorize transactions with biometrics, ensuring ease of use without compromising security.
